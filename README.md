# Responsive-Side-Bar
React Side Bar that moves from the side to the bottom of the page. 

I made a separate repository for this, because although it was a nice and interesting nav-bar, it didn't fit with the page. 

Regardless I didn't want to lose it forever. 

Created with the help from a tutorial of "fireship"

Technologies: React, HTML, CSS, (JSX)
